# FeatureSetEmbedding

This is an implementation of Feature set Embedding introduced in https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2010/hash/5f0f5e5f33945135b874349cfbed4fb9-Abstract.html.

I implemented this approach to handle missing data in a learning problem without the need of imputation. Here each instance is not considered as a vector, rather a set of (feature, value) pair.
